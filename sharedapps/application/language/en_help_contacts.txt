Dear user,

You are in the contact groups sharing system. Each group can be shared with colleagues, friends and family. Each change made by yourself will be seen by any participant of this contact group.

Your Google groups are shown on the left side. If you want one of them to share with their colleagues, family or friends - simply click on the name of the group and in the upper right corner of the turn sharing. Then add the emails of the people with whom you want to share the group.

Pay your attention, synchronization occurs every 15 minutes - so your changes will not be visible right away.

Good Luck!
